        As a BCA graduate with a solid foundation in computer science, I have dedicated the past three years to mastering Flutter development at Ralfiz Technologies. My experience there has honed my skills in creating efficient, high-performance mobile applications, and has provided me with a deep understanding of the complete app development lifecycle.
        <br />

Currently, I am expanding my expertise by interning in the MERN stack at Luminar Technologies. This internship is enabling me to gain hands-on experience with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, further diversifying my technical skill set and enhancing my ability to build comprehensive, full-stack web applications.



Passionate about staying at the forefront of technology, I am eager to continue growing and contributing to innovative projects. Whether itâ€™s developing seamless mobile experiences or robust web solutions, I am driven by the challenge of creating user-centric applications that solve real-world problems.
